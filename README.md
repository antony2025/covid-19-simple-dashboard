## Why yet another COVID-19 dashboard?

### Mobile friendly:
The popular dashboards like [WHO dashboard](https://covid19.who.int/) and [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) show
nice maps and large data tables with lot of info, but they are cumbersome when viewed in a mobile phone.

This dashboard takes a mobile-first approach, so small screen users can easily view the data.

### Order data by different criteria:
Eventhough Worldometer and others provide sorting functionality, they are difficult to use in small mobile screens.

This dashboard provides an easy to use select box to order the data by cumulative cases, cumulative deaths, deaths percentage, and so on.

### Search by country:
When using the WHO or Worldometer dashboards in small mobile screens, it is hard to search for a specific country that is not at the top of the list.

This dashboard provides a search box that quickly shows the searched country, just by typing the starting letters of the country name.

### Deaths percentage:
Worldometer shows a nice percentage of Recovered vs Deaths ratio as a percentage.
However, it does not show the actual percentage of deaths to confirmed cases on a per-country basis, and the ability to order the data based on the percentage.

This dashboard shows the percentage of deaths to confirmed cases on a per-country basis, and the ability to view data in ascending or descending order.

### No ads and tracking:

This website does not show any advertisements, collect user info, store cookies, and so on.
It's a completely stateless website.
